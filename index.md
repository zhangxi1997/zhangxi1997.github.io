# NExT-OOD Dataset

In recent years, multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) has become topical and achieves great progress. However, most pioneer multiple-choice VQA models are heavily driven by statistical correlations in datasets, which cannot perform well on multimodal understanding and suffer from poor generalization. In this paper, we identify two kinds of spurious correlations, i.e., a Vision-Answer bias (VA bias) and a Question-Answer bias (QA bias). To systematically and scientifically study these biases, we construct a new benchmark NExT-OOD in OOD setting. It is built upon the NExT-QA dataset and contains three sub-datasets including NExT-OOD-VA, NExT-OOD-QA, and NExT-OOD-VQA, which are designed for the VA bias, QA bias, and VA&QA bias, respectively.
